## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A backend API server (see SchoolSystem.Backend repository)
- **Note**: The frontend requires a running backend to function properly

### Backend Integration

⚠️ **Important**: This frontend is currently **NOT integrated** with a live backend.

To integrate with the backend:

1. **Read the Integration Guide**: [BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md](BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md)
2. **Test the Connection**: Open `integration-test.html` in your browser
3. **Configure the API URL**: Update `js/config.js` if needed
4. **Start your Backend**: Ensure SchoolSystem.Backend is running

For detailed integration instructions, see [BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md](BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbayleE/SchoolSystem.Frontend.git
cd SchoolSystem.Frontend
```

2. Configure the API endpoint:
   - Open `js/config.js`
   - Update `API_BASE_URL` to point to your backend server:
   ```javascript
   API_BASE_URL: 'http://your-backend-url:port/api'
   ```

3. Serve the application:
   - Using Python:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```
   - Using Node.js:
     ```bash
     npx http-server -p 8000
     ```
   - Or use any web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.)

4. Access the application:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

## Usage

### Logging In

1. Navigate to the login page (index.html)
2. Enter your email and password
3. Click "Login"
4. You'll be redirected to your role-specific dashboard

### Registering

1. Obtain an invitation code from your school administrator
2. Click "Register here" on the login page
3. Enter your invitation code and complete the registration form
4. After successful registration, you'll be redirected to login

### Navigating Dashboards

Each role has a unique dashboard with:
- Navigation bar with role-specific links
- Statistics cards showing key metrics
- Data tables for managing relevant information
- Logout button for secure session termination

### Role-Based Access

- Users can only access their designated dashboard
- Attempting to access another role's dashboard will redirect to your own
- All pages require authentication
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to login

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend through the API client (`js/api.js`). Key endpoints:

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration with invitation
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/auth/verify` - Verify token validity
- `POST /api/auth/validate-invitation` - Validate invitation code

### Users
- `GET /api/users/profile` - Get current user profile
- `GET /api/users` - List all users (admin only)
- `POST /api/users` - Create new user
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update user
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete user

### Schools
- `GET /api/schools` - List all schools
- `GET /api/schools/:id` - Get school details
- `POST /api/schools` - Create school
- `PUT /api/schools/:id` - Update school
- `DELETE /api/schools/:id` - Delete school

### Students, Teachers, Classes
- Similar CRUD operations available for each entity
- See `js/api.js` for complete endpoint list

## Customization

### Styling

Modify `css/main.css` to customize:
- Color scheme (CSS variables in `:root`)
- Typography
- Layout and spacing
- Component styles

### Adding New Features

1. Create new HTML page in `/pages/`
2. Add corresponding JavaScript file in `/js/`
3. Update navigation and routing in `auth.js`
4. Add API endpoints in `api.js` if needed

## Security Considerations

- Always use HTTPS in production
- Store tokens securely
- Implement CORS properly on backend
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize HTML to prevent XSS attacks
- Implement rate limiting on backend
- Use secure password requirements
- Regularly update dependencies

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
